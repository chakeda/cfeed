Open Source Live Website Traffic Feed

=====

cfeed is an open source web application similar to Feedjit that tracks a website’s internet traffic in real time. 

You can see it live here:

You can use it as well. It is deployed here:

There are three main ways to analyze web traffic: Feedjit, Statcounter, and Google Analytics. They all have their flaws and limitations, and cfeed aims a middle ground between those three applications. 

cfeed aims simplicity like Feedjit, but functionality like statcounter. cfeed’s current outlook resembles that of feedjit: however, it has a little bit more functionality, such as listing IP. Currently cfeed has a function that gets visitor data from http://freegeoip.net, so a lot more information can be listed, so long as the front end is developed. 

cfeed produces a script that the webmaster puts on the website header or sidebar. The script sends visitor data to the chakeda.com database. The visitor data is posted on live.php?website=thewebsitecom. 

So, it is very similar to Feedjit; but simple, open source, and (in the future) more functionality.
